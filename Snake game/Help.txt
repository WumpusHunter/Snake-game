 SNAKE GAME
 Snake is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line
that grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obs-
tacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade.
 GAMEPLAY
 The player controls an object on a bordered plane. As it moves
forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
The snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed
number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake
runs into the screen border or itself.
 A sole player attempts to eat items by running into them with the
head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so con-
trolling is progressively more difficult.
 CONTROL
 The snake moves forward automatically, everything you need to do
is to choose the direction of moving. To choose the direction of
moving use arrows-buttons, that is,
1) Left-arrow  - to move in the left direction;
2) Up-arrow    - to move in the up direction;
3) Right-arrow - to move in the right direction;
4) Down-arrow  - to move in the down direction.
Remember: you can't rotate the snake's head to opposite direction,
for instance, from the left to the right, or from the up to the
down.
 ADDITIONAL NOTES
 Good luck on the game, try to eat as much as you can!
